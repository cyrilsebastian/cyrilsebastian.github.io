Hi, I am Cyril Sebastian. Thanks for pausing on my site to know more about me.

Trying to use social media to be updated without saving cookies. But found of late,
the only secret is laziness. :)

Being a Unix/Linux fan, I always keep looking up on various new things happening around
and to optimize it in a best possible way however another reason for that may be because
Delhiities(a special breed of humans who often crib about traffic jams in the city, staying
in extreme summers or winters but barely feel it as they show and above all they always
keep their Aadhar ID cards handy with them just to show their Father's name if and only
if required at road rage, and found in the capital of India called Delhi) prefer doing so.
This actually keeps you occupied!!

In my free time though I am not free often apart from the time I get from WhatApp, Twitter,
movies, TV series and Youtube I love to sleep. Also trying to go for running for the last
couple of years.

Test and research without development is what I try not to end with, but my motive is to
make use of all skills which I dream off. So I have my own lovely playgrounds which helps
me to keep a record of my experiments. [Bashcodes](http://bashcodes.com/) is where explosions
happen and I try share the smoke with my own circle of viral media, when I get bombarded
with informations on Internet I love to add my part of opinion at [BuggingWeb](http://buggingweb.com).

These days I am spending more time on DevOps, Docker and Ansible. 

If you have something important for me, I'll love to hear from you. For quick replies you
can reach [@CyrilSebastian](https://twitter.com/CyrilSebastian) or you can contact me on
my email "cyril at buggingweb dot com".
